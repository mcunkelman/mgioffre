            <li>Our process is to first identify community needs by getting involved with local nonprofits and organizations. 
                We speak with residents. We tour the communities. 
                We dedicate time and effort to understanding what the community really wants. 
                We are currently helping to address the vacant home stock in the Wilkinsburg borough. </li>
            <li>We connect with homeowners through various means: letters, phone calls, real estate agents. 
                We like to build relationships with homeowners because 1) thatâ€™s who we are and 2) 
                it allows us to make sure we are giving the homeowners exactly what they need. If our initial conversation 
                leads us to believe that we could work out an agreement, we schedule a time to see the property in person. 
                We recognize that COVID-19 is a very real presence right now, and so if you would prefer that we did a virtual tour instead, 
                we can arrange that as well.</li>
            <li>We are able to purchase homes from homeowners quickly and with cash, 
                but we are also able to be flexible in the event the homeowner needs a bit more time to complete the purchase process. 
                We keep all parties informed and abreast of every step of the purchase process. </li>
            <li>After the purchase, we usually rehab the home, depending on the needs of the property. 
                We rehab the homes in such a way that we would want to live there.</li>
            <li>Depending on the needs of the community we either rent, sell, or lease-option the property once the rehab is complete.</li>
            </ol>
